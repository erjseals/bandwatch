The SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) benchmark is derived from the code provided by Andrea Vedaldi at http://www.vlfeat.org/~vedaldi/code/sift.html, retrieved June 18, 2007. A later version of the component has been incorporated into the VLFeat open source package (http://VLFeat.org), 0.9.4.1.

The header files of the code contain the following license:

  implementation is original (in particular, it is <em>not</em> derived
  from <a shape="rect" href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/keypoints/">Lowe's
   implementation</a>), the SIFT algorithm has been issued a
  patent. Thus you should note that:</p>

 <blockquote style="font-style:italic;">
  This software embodies a method for which the following patent has
  been issued: &quot;Method and apparatus for identifying scale invariant
  features in an image and use of same for locating an object in an
  image,&quot; David G. Lowe, US Patent 6,711,293 (March 23,
  2004). Provisional application filed March 8, 1999. Asignee: The
  University of British Columbia.

We have modified SIFT in the following ways:

- we generated a standalone C version from the Matlab source files of SIFT.
- we augmented the code in order to support collection of benchmarking data (matlab and C)
- we create benchmark inputs for the code (matlab and C)
- we modified the code to use our own standardized library for common functions (matlab and C)

Our modifications are available under the same license as above, since UCSD is also
part of the University of California.
