We have modified Texture Synthesis in the following ways:

- we generated a standalone C version from the Matlab source.
- we augmented the code in order to support collection of benchmarking data (matlab and C)
- we create benchmark inputs for the code (matlab and C)
- we modified the code to use our own standardized library for common functions (matlab and C)
- Note: The algorithm for texture synthesis has been modified according to 
    "Ashikhmin, M. "Synthesizing Natural Textures" The proceedings of 2001 ACM Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics, Research Triangle Park, NorthCarolina March 19-21, pp. 217-226".
