The SD-VBS suite is designed to be portable across different platforms. If you would like 
port it, you need to set appropriate platform specific commands.

By default, SD-VBS is set to the x86-64 bit architecture for the Linux operating system. The platform
specific commands for this configuration can be found in SD-VBS/Portability/386-gcc.h. This configuration
file is included in SD-VBS/Makefile.common.

To change the platform specific commands:
1. Modify/Add <Architecture>-gcc.h file appropriately
2. Include <Architecture>-gcc.h file in SD-VBS/Makefile.common

We have included a few sample configuration files in SD-VBS/Portability directory.
These correspond to:

1. x386 architecture, 32-64 bit
3. SPARC architecture, 32-64 bit

Note:

SD-VBS has been tested on x86 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. If the user encounters undesired behavior
while running the SD-VBS on other platforms, please report the bugs to:
