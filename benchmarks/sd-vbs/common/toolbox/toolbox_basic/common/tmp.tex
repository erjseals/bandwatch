Hi Prof. Geiger,

	My name is Jianbo Shi.  I am a graduate student working
with Jitendra Malik at UC Berkeley.    My current research interest is
on the topic of grouping and perceptual organization.  I have read
many of your works in this area.

	I will be giving a talk at NECI and David Sarnoff Lab on Dec. 8
and 9 on ``Normalized cuts and its application to motion segmentation''.
I am wondering if I could visit you and your lab on Dec. 10.  I would
very much like the opportunity to talk to you on varies topics related
to the problem of grouping.  Let me know if that is possible.

	-thanks!
