function n2 = dist2(x, c)
%DIST2	Calculates squared distance between two sets of points.
%
%	Description
%	D = DIST2(X, C) takes two matrices of vectors and calculates the
%	squared Euclidean distance between them.  Both matrices must be of
%	the same column dimension.  If X has M rows and N columns, and C has
%	L rows and N columns, then the result has M rows and L columns.  The
%	I, Jth entry is the  squared distance from the Ith row of X to the
%	Jth row of C.
