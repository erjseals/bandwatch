The MSER (Maximally Stable Extremal Region) benchmark is derived from the source provided by Andrea Vedaldi 
at http://www.vlfeat.org/~vedaldi/code/mser.html, version 0.4.  A later
version of the component, version .5, has since been incorporated into the VLFeat open source 
package (http://VLFeat.org), version 0.9.4.1. 

The header files of the version .4 MSER code contain the following license:

We have modified MSER in the following ways:

- we generated a standalone C version from the mser.mex.c source.
- we augmented the code in order to support collection of benchmarking data (matlab and C)
- we create benchmark inputs for the code (matlab and C)
- we modified the code to use our own standardized library for common functions (matlab and C)

Our modifications are available under the same license as above, since UCSD is also
part of the University of California.
